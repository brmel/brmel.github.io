#### Innovation with the Aurora Imaging Library
Following the acquisition, I took on a Senior role. I built the new **Advanced Geometric Matcher API** using C++, utilizing geometry and non-linear optimization to solve difficult alignment problems. I am responsible for the core AIL modules (Calibration, Metrology) that power our customers' vision systems.

#### Solving Real-World Customer Problems
I don't just write code; I make sure it works for the client. I help customers debug complex image processing applications and support the UI team in building the **AIL Copilot**. I also mentor interns and work in an Agile environment (using Jira and Git) to ensure our team delivers high-quality software efficiently.

#### Bridging Classic Vision and AI
I started my professional career as a Software Developer in the Image Processing department. My first major impact was developing the **Random Forest Classifier** for the Matrox Imaging Library (MIL). This project allowed me to classify objects in industrial applications, successfully combining classic computer vision with machine learning.

#### Ensuring Industrial Quality
I was responsible for maintaining core 2D MIL modules like **Model Finder** and **Edge Finder**. Beyond coding, I developed automatic testing tools to verify algorithm performance. This taught me the importance of writing robust code that doesn't break when deployed in factories around the world.

#### A Competitive Scholarship Journey
I moved to Canada after being selected for the **Al Ghurair Foundation Scholarship**. I was one of approximately 100 recipients chosen from over 15,000 applicants based on merit. This opportunity allowed me to pursue my Master's in Control System Engineering with a focus on robotics and AI.

#### Solving Hard Physics Problems with C++
I loved combining code with physics. One of my proudest academic achievements was designing a digital PID controller on a **QNX real-time operating system** using C++ to control an **Inverted Pendulum**. I handled everything from system modeling to the final implementation, proving my ability to make hardware work with software.

#### Top 1% Academic Performance
I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Control Systems, ranking **5th out of 1400 students** (Top 1%) with a GPA of 17.5/20. During this time, I built a strong foundation in industrial process identification, PLC programming, and optimization strategies that I still use today.

#### Early Control Systems Work
For my final project at the CDTA research center, I developed an **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)** system for autonomous vehicles. I implemented the control strategy on a "TORCS" driving simulator and simulated the performance using MATLAB/Simulink, sparking my deep interest in robotics and automation.
