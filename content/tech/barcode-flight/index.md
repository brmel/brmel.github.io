One day I was in Düsseldorf airport to take a flight. I had already checked-in online and only had the barcode on my phone.

When I arrived at the security checkpoint to scan my barcode, it didn’t work. I was already late. I tried every zoom, rotation… nothing.
The security guy told me I needed to go back to the check-in gate and hope they were still there to print a paper boarding pass.

But then I realized: my phone was in dark mode, and the barcode was shown with dark as foreground color. So I just switched to light mode… and it saved me time, my flight, and a lot of stress.

I really hope Düsseldorf airport and all airports improve their barcode reader.

Want to know more about foreground color support for example in Aurora imaging library? Read this link : [https://lnkd.in/eEKXeeWp](https://lnkd.in/eEKXeeWp)

Thank you.
