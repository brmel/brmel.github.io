I'm a **Senior Software Developer** at **Zebra Technologies** with 5+ years of experience in machine vision and image processing. I specialize in developing advanced algorithms that combine classical computer vision with cutting-edge AI.

## Current Role
At Zebra Technologies, I design and implement machine vision algorithms in C++ using Matrox Imaging Library. I lead the development of the **Advanced Geometric Matcher (AGM) API** and maintain critical modules like Model Finder, Edge Finder, and Measurement systems. My work involves solving complex mathematical problems with geometry, algebra, and nonlinear optimizations.

Previously at Matrox Imaging (2019-2022), I built the foundation of my industrial experience developing robust machine vision algorithms and the Random Forest Classifier for object classification.

## Education
**Master's in Control Systems Engineering** from Polytechnique Montreal (2019) with a 3.87/4 GPA. I graduated **top 1% nationally** in Algeria (5/1400) and received the prestigious **Al Ghurair Foundation Scholarship** (1 of 100 from 15,000+ applicants).

**Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering** from Ã‰cole Nationale Polytechnique, Algeria (2017) with a 17.5/20 GPA.

## Technical Skills
**Programming**: C++, C, Python, Flutter/Dart, MATLAB, VHDL  
**Tools**: Git/GitHub, ROS, MATLAB/Simulink, QNX, Unity-Pro  
**Specializations**: Real-time systems, Computer vision, Machine learning, Control theory

## Notable Projects
- **AGM API Development**: Next-generation pattern matching technology for industrial applications
- **Adaptive Cruise Control**: Advanced ACC system for autonomous vehicles during my Master's
- **Distributed Robot Control**: Multi-robot coordination using consensus algorithms
- **Memory Tracker**: Open-source C++ library for process memory monitoring

## What Drives Me
I'm passionate about solving engineering challenges that bridge theory and practice. Whether developing vision systems for quality control, implementing control algorithms for autonomous systems, or optimizing real-time performance, I thrive at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and technology.

My experience spans academic research to production-ready solutions, giving me a unique perspective on translating concepts into robust systems that solve real-world problems.
