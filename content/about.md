# About Me

I am passionate about image processing, C++ programming, control theory, robotics, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy solving physical and mathematical problems that bridge theory and practical applications.

## Professional Experience

### Industrial Image Processing
While working at **Matrox** and **Zebra Technology**, I designed and implemented image processing algorithms with industry standards, employing complex mathematics, physics, and machine learning. My work focused on:

- Developing robust computer vision solutions for industrial applications
- Implementing real-time image processing algorithms in C++
- Applying machine learning techniques to improve algorithm performance
- Ensuring compliance with industry standards and requirements

## Academic Background

During my Master's degree studies, I developed several control systems, both linear and nonlinear, including:

### Autonomous Vehicle Systems
- **Adaptive Cruise Control** for autonomous vehicles - designed and implemented control algorithms that adapt to varying driving conditions

### Robotics Control
- **Nonlinear control system for the inverted pendulum** - developed advanced control strategies for unstable systems
- **Digital controller robust to information loss** - created distributed control systems for robot displacement that maintain performance even with communication failures

## Areas of Expertise

- **Image Processing & Computer Vision**: Industrial applications, algorithm optimization, real-time processing
- **C++ Programming**: High-performance computing, algorithm implementation, system-level programming
- **Control Theory**: Linear and nonlinear control systems, adaptive control, robust control
- **Robotics**: Control systems, path planning, distributed systems
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine learning applications in image processing and control systems

## Technical Interests

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of these fields, where mathematical rigor meets practical engineering challenges. Whether it's developing vision systems for quality control, implementing control algorithms for autonomous systems, or solving complex optimization problems, I thrive on tackling multidisciplinary challenges.

Feel free to explore my articles to learn more about these topics and see practical implementations of the concepts I work with.
