# Welcome to Ibraverse

I am passionate about image processing, C++ programming, control theory, robotics, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy solving physical and mathematical problems.

While working at Matrox and Zebra Technology, I designed and implemented image processing algorithms with industry standards, employing complex mathematics, physics, and machine learning.

Additionally, during my Master's degree studies, I developed several control systems, both linear and nonlinear, such as:
- Adaptive Cruise Control for autonomous vehicles
- A nonlinear control system for the inverted pendulum
- A digital controller robust to the loss of information to control robots' displacement with a distributed system
