# 🎉 Your Website is Now Live!

## ✅ What's Been Completed

Your Hugo website has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages! Here's what happened:

1. **✅ Copied your website** from private `ibraverse` to public `brmel.github.io`
2. **✅ Set up GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment
3. **✅ Pushed to GitHub** and triggered the first build
4. **✅ Configured for custom domain** `ibraverse.ca`

## 🌐 Your Website URLs

- **GitHub Pages URL:** https://brmel.github.io/
- **Custom Domain:** https://ibraverse.ca (after DNS setup)

## 📋 Final Setup Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (Required)
Visit: https://github.com/brmel/brmel.github.io/settings/pages

**Configure these settings:**
- **Source:** Deploy from a branch
- **Branch:** main
- **Folder:** / (root)
- **Custom domain:** ibraverse.ca
- **Enforce HTTPS:** ✓ (check this box)

### 2. Configure DNS for Your Domain

At your domain registrar (where you bought ibraverse.ca), add these DNS records:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A  
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @  
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: brmel.github.io
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment

- **Build Status:** https://github.com/brmel/brmel.github.io/actions
- **Repository:** https://github.com/brmel/brmel.github.io

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Making Changes to Your Website

```bash
# Navigate to your public repository
cd /Users/brahim/Projects/Ibraverse/brmel.github.io

# Make changes to your content
# Edit files in content/posts/ or other directories

# Deploy changes
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or manually:
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push origin main
```

### Local Development

```bash
cd /Users/brahim/Projects/Ibraverse/brmel.github.io
hugo server -D
# Visit: http://localhost:1313
```

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
Your Setup:
├── brmel/ibraverse (private)          # Backup repository
├── brmel/brmel.github.io (public)     # Live website (source + deployment)
└── Custom Domain: ibraverse.ca        # Your professional URL
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Immediate:** GitHub Pages URL should work within 5-10 minutes
- **1-2 hours:** SSL certificate for custom domain
- **24-48 hours:** DNS propagation for ibraverse.ca

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Pages isn't working:
1. Check repository is public
2. Enable GitHub Pages in settings
3. Verify the workflow completed successfully

### If custom domain isn't working:
1. Verify DNS records at your registrar
2. Check CNAME file exists in repository
3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
4. Ensure HTTPS is enforced in GitHub settings

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Visit GitHub Pages settings** and configure as described above
2. **Set up DNS** with your domain registrar  
3. **Test your site** at https://brmel.github.io/
4. **Wait for DNS** to propagate to access via ibraverse.ca

Your website is now live and accessible on the internet! 🚀
