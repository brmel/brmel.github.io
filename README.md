## 🎯 About

This website shares insights from my work in **image processing**, **control theory**, **robotics**, and **artificial intelligence**. It features practical applications from my professional experience at Matrox and Zebra Technology, as well as research from my academic projects.

### Topics Covered

- **Image Processing & Computer Vision**: Industrial algorithms and OpenCV applications
- **Control Theory**: Linear and nonlinear control systems for robotics and autonomous vehicles
- **C++ Programming**: High-performance computing and algorithm implementation
- **Robotics**: Control systems, path planning, and distributed systems

## 🚀 Featured Content

**Coming Soon:** Comprehensive tutorials on industrial image processing and computer vision techniques.

## 🛠️ Built With
